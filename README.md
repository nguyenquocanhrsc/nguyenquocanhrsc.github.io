- Sub-researched on Encryption and Blockchain in data privacy, simulated Federated Learning environments for Zksnark implementation to protect healthcare data training and transmission.
- Pitched research gap, managed weekly projects and meetings, and generated mathematical reports/notations for papers. 

**Academic and Communication English Tutor @ Freelance (_February 2021 - November 2022_)**
- 1:1 tutoring for 7 students  (2 Onsite and 5 Online); Taught communication English for DM&C’s Korean CEO and a Japanese.  
- Focused on IELTS Academic training (Reading, Writing, and Speaking) and designed personalised study plans for each individual.
- Gave academic consultancy to more than 200 students' work, improving their critical thinking ability and university GPA. 
- 100% students achieved their expected band score overall (1 Bronze medal in the National English Test for the Gifted).


## PROJECTS
### Phase Space Reconstructed Hybrid Deep Learning Model for Stock Price Forecasting
[[Publication](https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4729759)] [[Poster](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17MK5haNZRQVOfrIkB0W8WmQ2xbV5spam/view)] [[Presentation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zX1CkDwcXVwKcjbFDhl0hmS6ljlWbj6G/view)] [[Certificate](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iinbKE5oRFV3oaostxl5UVft7uJR7oTe/view?usp=sharing)]

Constructed a hybrid CNN-BiLSTM-GRU model with tailored embedding dimension and time delay for Phase Space Reconstruction to forecast stock prices of major retailers like Target (TGT), Amazon (AMZN) and Walmart (WMT). Being trained across 16,000 daily observations from different stock nature, the model significantly improved forecasting accuracy, reducing MAE by 37.2% and RMSE by 35.1%, showcasing the potential of incorporating Chaos Theory in algorithmic trading strategies. This project was accepted for presentation and abstract publication at Digital3 Conference, RMIT Experience Day (Hanoi and HCMC), and RMIT Showcase: Impact in 2023. A refined version of this project has been submitted to the IEEE.
