## WORK EXPERIENCE
**AI Systems and LLMs Trainer @ Outlier, San Francisco, California, United States (_April 2024 - Present_)**
- Trained multiple AI bots to be proficient in Vietnamese under the Bulba Project, improved LLMs responding logic by generating highly natural prompt for multiple turns in one conversation.
- Engineered prompts to reach the highest accuracy and rationality, surpassed ChatGPT-4 linguistic capability, leveraged copywriting skills to generate native Vietnamese dialouges.
- Monitored continuous system responses to spot errors, flagged the bugs to Team Lead for review or attempted to re-regulate the language system from scratch. 
  
**Collaborative Researcher @ The Business School, RMIT Vietnam, Department of Economics and Finance (_March 2023 - Present_)**
- Mined and cleaned data from web APIs or open source and developed ML/DL-based predictive models integrating Chaos Theory that improved time series forecasting performance by over 50%.
- Experienced with ARIMA/SARIMA, Random Forest, XGBoost, LSTM, and Transformer, engineered financial datasets with SMA, MACD, RSI, etc., performed A/B testing and L1/L2 regularization.  
- Sub-researched on Encryption and Blockchain in data privacy, simulated Federated Learning environments for Zksnark implementation to protect healthcare data training and transmission.
- Pitched research gap, managed weekly projects and meetings, and generated mathematical reports/notations for papers. 

**Academic and Communication English Tutor @ Freelance (_February 2021 - November 2022_)**
- 1:1 tutoring for 7 students  (2 Onsite and 5 Online); Taught communication English for DM&C’s Korean CEO and a Japanese.  
- Focused on IELTS Academic training (Reading, Writing, and Speaking) and designed personalised study plans for each individual.
- Gave academic consultancy to more than 200 students' work, improving their critical thinking ability and university GPA. 
- 100% students achieved their expected band score overall (1 Bronze medal in the National English Test for the Gifted).


## PROJECTS
### Phase Space Reconstructed Hybrid Deep Learning Model for Stock Price Forecasting
[[Publication](https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4729759)] [[Poster](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17MK5haNZRQVOfrIkB0W8WmQ2xbV5spam/view)] [[Presentation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zX1CkDwcXVwKcjbFDhl0hmS6ljlWbj6G/view)] [[Certificate](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iinbKE5oRFV3oaostxl5UVft7uJR7oTe/view?usp=sharing)]

- Developed a hybrid CNN-BiLSTM-GRU model, optimized with tailored embedding dimensions and time delays for PSR.
- Applied the model to forecast stock prices for major retailers including Target (TGT), Amazon (AMZN), and Walmart (WMT).
- Utilized 16,000 daily stock data points from diverse stock categories to train the model.
- Achieved a significant reduction in Mean Absolute Error (MAE) by 37.2% and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) by 35.1%, demonstrating the efficacy of incorporating Chaos Theory into algorithmic trading.
- Presented the project at the Digital3 Conference, RMIT Experience Day in Hanoi and HCMC, and RMIT Showcase: Impact in 2023.
- A refined version of the project was submitted to the IEEE.
