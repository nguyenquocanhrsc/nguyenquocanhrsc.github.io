## Projects
### Phase Space Reconstructed Hybrid Deep Learning Model for Stock Price Forecasting
[[Publication](https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4729759)] [[Poster](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17MK5haNZRQVOfrIkB0W8WmQ2xbV5spam/view)] [[Presentation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zX1CkDwcXVwKcjbFDhl0hmS6ljlWbj6G/view)]

Under the supervision of lecturers in 3 months, a hybrid CNN-BiLSTM-GRU model with tailored embedding dimension and time delay for Phase Space Reconstruction was constructed to forecast stock prices of major retailers like Target (TGT), Amazon (AMZN) and Walmart (WMT). The model significantly improved accuracy, reducing MAE by 37.2% and RMSE by 35.1%, showcasing the potential of incorporating Chaos Theory in algorithmic trading strategies. This project was accepted for presentation and abstract publication at Digital3 Conference, RMIT Experience Day (Hanoi and HCMC), RMIT Project Love Meter (winner), and RMIT Showcase: Impact om 2023. A refined version of this project has been submitted to IEEE.

### Decoding Physical and Cognitive Impacts of Particulate Matter Concentrations at Ultra-Fine Scales
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/4240)

Used **Matlab** to train over 100 machine learning models which estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.
